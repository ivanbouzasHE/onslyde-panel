## Getting Started
The only prerequisite is node.js 0.6.15+ on your path.

* run 'scripts/web-server.js'
* open the example panel 'http://localhost:8001/example-panel.html'
* to interact, open the panel remote 'http://localhost:8001/panel-remote.html?session=194'
* Note - the default session is '194'. If you are making changes and testing locally, [you'll need a new private session](http://onslyde.com/) <- click the "create presentation" button.
